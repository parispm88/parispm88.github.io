description: Who am I? What have I done? What do I want to do? This is a quick blog post to provide a bit of background about myself; what I've been up to for the last ten years or so, and what I plan on doing from here on out.

## TLDR

Shawn and I started a company called Free Dominion Studios, LLC. after college while I was on active duty in the US Army to make Video Games. We made one that fully released on Android and iOS called Pixel Trip. It received a lot of good reviews but ultimately wasn't succesful enough and we shutdown Free Dominion Studios, LLC. to reprioritize our full-time jobs.

## PARIS BROTHERS

Originally the idea of making Video Games started when my brother Shawn and I would take road trips to and from various family members houses. We'd spend hours discussing what we thought was a good game concept and where we thought other games could improve. Eventually I got older and so did Shawn; I had to pick a place to go to college and he was transitioning out of the Air Force. I suggested we both go to Full Sail University in Orlando, FL - practically across the planet at the time for me. We looked it over discussed it with my Dad and after a few trips to visit the campus it was offical. My brother and I were on our ways to getting our education in Game Development and Design. Fast forward seven years and both of us were in totally different career fields - I ended up enlisting into the Army after being a Sales Associate with Best Buy for a few years. Shawn went back to Full Sail to get his Master's Degree in Game Design and eventually a full-time job with them as a Teacher's Assistant. We were in wildly different careers than where we wanted to be.

## TIME FOR CHANGE

Something had to give and after another road trip to visit family while I was on leave. I said to Shawn that I thought it would be cool if we built a game together. He said that was a great idea and so we began to build a team. We started with a smaller team and pitching a grand vision for a game we both were excited about. Obviously we were new to this and just thought well we can do anything. It was exciting to talk about this game but impossible for us to build without a bigger team. We needed people and we decided to recurit others to get the talent we needed to make this game become a reality. We found a few other people and eventually we had a sizeable group almost in the thirty plus range. We were making small incremental progress in a few areas like Art and Design but no progress on Gameplay or on the programming front. We needed engineers to make the vision a reality but not because we didn't already have some. We needed someone with experience and enough bandwidth to handle the work load we needed. After looking around we started to realize that it may not happen. We were already pretty far along into this project, we'd built an LLC around it - Free Dominion Studios, set up processes for managing that, coordinated through meetings remotely and worked on tasks to present every week. It was all engaging and interesting and everyone seemed to be having a great time, but time has a funny way of wearing down on you and we were no exception. Time started to pass and we weren't making any great strides towards an MVP. It was time to look at our options we'd lost a few people already - it was becoming painfully obvious we didn't have the expertise we needed - but, we knew we wanted to do something, we owed everyone that at least.

## AND MORE CHANGE

We held a meeting with the remaining team members and gave them the honest truth about the project we were working on. The group suggested we work on something smaller in scope that took a specific amount of time. We all agreed and we shutdown the old game concept to work full time on Pixel Trip. It was a pitch from one of our Artists and was a mobile game meant to be an addicting reflex puzzle game. It was a lot of fun to make and a lot more fun to play. We had a lot of great reviews but ultimately it just didn't do well enough to warrant anyone going full-time for Free Dominion Studios. We eventually decided that the time had come to shut down Free Dominion and focus on our full-time jobs. It was a sad day to say good bye but it was all fufilling work and I think it was enough to help everyone land their next jobs.
