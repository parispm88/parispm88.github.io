description: I recently got this website up and running from a template I found at jekyllthemes.io (which I recommend). I modified the original template slightly to get to where it is now and I'd like to go over how I did that here.

## WHERE TO [BEGIN](https://homepages.wmich.edu/~korista/hawking-time.html)

First, I think the questions I started with were:

1. Did I want my own Domain Name? **Yes**
2. How did I want to Host my website?? **Not sure??**
3. What tools did I want to use to build my website??? **No [IDEA](https://memegenerator.net/img/instances/28462176/not-sure-if-thats-a-good-idea-or-a-great-idea.jpg)???**
4. Oh Man, Where do I begin???? **Nervous reactions... feeling [overwhelmed](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/80/01/ed/8001ed7d6e7a3b212a84ba2f2cadb460.jpg)...**

Yah - all jokes aside I felt a little overwhelmed about where to begin. This isn't just a simple program you can just call from the commandline. It's gotta conform to some standards and be hosted through the internet. I obviously had to begin with some research... soooo, I did what all scholars do and I cracked open a Web Development Boooo... [google](https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=%22best+way+to+build+a+portfolio+website%22)... I went to [google](https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=%22best+way+to+build+a+portfolio+website%22). Yup, I began with a few simple searches for, ["best way to build a portfolio website"](https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=%22best+way+to+build+a+portfolio+website%22). A few entries down the list I found this awesome website:

## [GITHUB PAGES](https://pages.github.com/)

**Description:** This video will cover the fundamentals of what [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) are and how you can use them.

Also, I would check out the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) wesbite which has a load of high quality trainings and then head over to their youtube channel - it's pretty dope [freeCodeCamp YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/Freecodecamp/featured). 

From there I was led to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and this thing called [Jekyll](https://www.jekyllrb.com). After spending a few more searches on google I ended up finding a lot of material related to both topics. I'm not going to break down every step I took, but here's the gist of what I recommend you do when starting this process for yourself. Head over to [JekyllThemes.io](https://jekyllthemes.io/) and take a look at their templates / themes. These can save you a ton of time on configuration and set up all for a very affordable price (if not free).

Once you've gotten your theme from there follow the steps on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). For those of you that didn't click the link it's:

1. [Create a Repository](https://github.com/new)
2. Clone the Repository
3. Build a Hello World Page
4. Push it up to origin
5. Browse to your site @ https://[username].github.io

*replace the [username] portion with your own awesome username*

Now this tutorial doesn't go over Jekyll or what it's benefits are, but it does get you a bare bones run down of how the workflow works.

## [JEKYLL](https://www.jekyllrb.com)

As for [Jekyll](https://www.jekyllrb.com), you'll want to head over to their main website which has a plethora of content all around what, how, and why you should use Jekyll. 

Check it out here: [Jekyll](https://www.jekyllrb.com)

However, I'm more of a video tutorial kind of guy so here's what I used:

## [GITHUB](https://github.com/parispm88/parispm88.github.io)

Seriously though after all of the tutorials and some time spent looking over each of the benefits of both [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://www.jekyllrb.com). Head over to [GitHub](https://www.github.com) and start making your site. After a few days messing around with the theme I purchased I was able to put this site together (which still needs a few adjustments). If you'd like to see everything I did to include all the code I added (this was a just get it working mentality) you can head over to my repo here: [GITHUB](https://github.com/parispm88/parispm88.github.io)

Send me an email through my [CONTACT ME](https://www.parispm88.com/contact) page - let me know how I did or tell me how dumb I am ðŸ˜„.
