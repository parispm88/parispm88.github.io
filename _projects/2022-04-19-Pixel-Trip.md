# BACKGROUND

Free Dominion Studios (FDS), LLC. was a business venture that my brother Shawn and I started together in 2014. We had always wanted to create unique experiences for players. Over the next four years though we learned just how difficult it was to deliver on that idea.

## WHO WAS INVOLVED

Our team at FDS were some of the most talented and brightest individuals I've had the pleasure of working with. Each and everyone of the team members brought valuable skills and contributed far and above what I thought we were going to be able to produce back then. We were a hodge podge of Full Sail Alumni all hungry to create a name for ourselves and get something on our resumes.
## WHAT I DID

I was the Chief Technology Officer so I had to deliver on that and provide the team with the tools needed to succeed. I spent the majority of my time helping actually write systems to include the game modes and various scoring mechanisms. I worked with the team to ensure we were on track and helped overcome any bottlenecks or blockers. I ran all the stand ups and conducted all of the reviews. I helped build our marketing platform to include building a website and social media presence. I contributed to the distribution efforts and production release efforts. I poured countless hours into the project and tried to help design and implement additional features to ensure continuous engagement.

## WHAT DID WE MAKE

We were a scrappy bunch and had many various prototypes that just didn't live up to our expectations. Eventually we all decided we needed to do something with a better scope and shorter turn around. We had a meet up and through enough collaboration we landed on Pixel Trip - a mobile game designed to be fast paced and engaging. We made it simple with the concept of matching colors that make a tetris shape on a grid but only have one correct combination on the grid that the player could swipe to continue to the next challenge. We had a scaling grid system that increased in size and provided intrinsic difficulty just by introducing more tiles. We tracked points for performance and ensured those that couldn't beat the clock were given opportunities to save themselves and potential get a higher score. Overall it was a very simple initial concept that showcased the multiple ways in which we could adjust minor things that had great implications on the gameplay experience without degrading the learned method of engagement.

## WHAT I LEARNED

I did a lot - but, not enough. The game for what it was - was well recieved and in my opinion it was fun. However, with where we were as a team and the fact that a majority of our members were not programmers it became painfully obvious that we would struggle to implement the complete set of features needed without more time. Time I believe each and everyone of us was just not willing to extend past what was already given. Teams can get burned out and morale is difficult to maintain for an extended period of time without tangible successes. It's not on any one member but rather the team to help focus and scope their efforts into small wins to galvanize everyone to complete their work and contribute to a better product. Having spent at this time about four years of my life I realized it was time for me to redirect my efforts and focus on my military career. Where one was not competing against the other but rather where I could focus on one to eventually lead me to the other. It was around that time I decided to earn my commission and join the newly formed Cyber Branch of the US Army. I was luckily selected and through many years of effort and training have finally made it to a point where I am confident in my skills as a programmer. I'm grateful for the efforts of FDS and to each of the members that worked with my day in and day out. It is what helped me realize what I want to do in life and that's to be a Gameplay Engineer. Nothing brought me more joy than to see someone engaged and excited about software I wrote solely for their entertainment. So, Thank you, Free Dominion Studios - I don't know if I have ever had the chance to formally say that, but I wouldn't be where I am today if not for you.
